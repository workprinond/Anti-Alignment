# Anti-Alignments for Measuring Precision and Generalization
In this project, we implement a novel approach based on the paper [“A Unified Approach for Measuring Precision and Generalization based on Anti-alignments,”](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01406850)
written by B.F. van Dongen et. al. The approach aims to provide a better estimation of precision and generalization by using ​anti-alignments​.
An anti-alignment is a run of a model that deviates
as much as possible from any trace contained in the corresponding event log.
