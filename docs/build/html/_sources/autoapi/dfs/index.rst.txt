.. function:: findPaths(G, im, em, n)

   finds all correct paths of length n in the graph

   this function returns all paths of length n that begin in the initial
   marking and end in the final marking. The paths then contain the labels that
   are present on the edges visited on the path

       :param graph G: networkx MultiDiGraph G
       :param marking im: initial petri net marking im
       :param marking em: end/final petri net marking em
       :param int n: path length of alignments                 
       :return: all paths of length n as an array containing the cases
       that are present on the edges takes by the algorithm
   :rtype: arr
       


.. function:: findPathsRecursive(G, u, n)

   finds all paths of length n in the graph

   this method does an edge depth first search through the graph of length an, considering
   all edges staring from the given node u

       :param graph G: networkx MultiDiGraph G
       :param node u: the current node u
       :param int n: search depth at the current recursion point
   :return: all paths of length n
